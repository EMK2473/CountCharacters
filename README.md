## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux.

```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/EMK2473/CountCharacters.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd CountCharacters 
```
- Compile the CountCharacters.java file: 
```Java
- javac CountCharacters.java 
```
- Run the program:

```

## Description
A simple Java program that counts the occurrences of a specified character in a given string. The user provides both the character and the string, and the program will output how many times the character appears in the string.

## Application Usage
Once the program is running, it will prompt you to input a character and a string. The program counts the occurrences of the specified character in the string and outputs the count. If there is only one occurrence, it outputs without a plural "s"; otherwise, it adds "s."  

Example:

Input:
```Java
a banana 
```
Output:

```Java
3 a's 
```

Singular case: 

Input: 
```Java
a cat 
```
Output:
```Java
1 a
```
